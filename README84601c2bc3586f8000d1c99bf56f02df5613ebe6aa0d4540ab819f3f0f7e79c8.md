NOTE: Code provided works well with Pytorch 1.12.1.

Prerequisites:
PyTorch
Pandas
Numpy


Dataset:
1. MovieLens 100K           https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
2. MovieLens 1M		    https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

Python files:

1. MF_AI contins the program for Matrix Factorization.
2. con_fusion contains the program for fusion function.
3. M_orig contains the code for original MF based recommedation using Movielens 100K dataset.
4. M_faulty_final contains the code for creating faulty recommendation model, intermediate recommendation model and final model.
5. 1M_um contains code to create a utility matrix using the Movielens 1M dataset. It can be used in place of the Movilens 100K dataset utility matrix creation in the M_orig and M_faulty_final files.
